# PyGame Engine - Raycaster

This is a test to see if I could create a simple game engine using PyGame.

The idea is that this will become a raycasting engine (see https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) in the same vein as Wolfenstein 3D/Doom.

## Software used
- Python 3.8.3
    - PyGame 2.0.1
    - Colorama 0.4.4
    - Coloredlogs 15.0

## Engine documentation
Tell future me to write this once the engine actually works
